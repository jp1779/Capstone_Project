### Group Info
- Main is the default branch. It is not protected, so you are free to push
code into it as long as it does not affect other parts of the program in
a negative way. If you are worried about this, you may work on another branch
and create a pull request so someone else reviews the code.
- Coding will be done in Python, you can use any development environment you like.
- Tasks for the team will be posted under the issues tab. They
will have information on who the task is assigned to, what should be done, and the
time you should ideally complete the task by.
- Communicate with the team if you are having issues or need help. Make sure to take
note of said issues so that we can present them in our weekly reports.

### Meeting Times
- The group will meet in the library from 1:30PM - 2:45PM each Tuesday and Thursday,
unless otherwise stated.
- If you can not make it, please let the rest of the team know at least a day before the meeting.
